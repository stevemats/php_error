Autologger program which can be used to capture keystrokes in for the pourpose
of security testings.The autogenerated keystrokes are later stored under 
php_errorLog.txt is.
The program was for Learning and testing pourposes only on how keyloggers,trojans e.t.c 
being part of a security deficiency, are able to operate and retrieve Information from personal
computers(e.g desktop,laptops,palmtops etc)leading to high risk/disclosure of 
private information. Due to a long time with out a stable release, antivirus are able to detect
the program with ease..changes will be made to try and evade antiviruses as time goes and as 
patches get released.
You may have noticed the program has a low rate alerting name almost for the less suspecious 
to not notice it incase they come into contact with the keylogger in there computers. And if 
properly installed at a less suspecious directory,the victim can mistake it of something else.
